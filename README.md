## 1. Project Overview
**Problem Statement**

Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) is a critical factor influencing human health, comfort, and productivity. Pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10), high levels of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can accumulate in poorly ventilated indoor environments like homes, schools, and offices. Many of these spaces lack real-time, accessible monitoring, leaving occupants unaware of potential health risks.

**Proposed Solution**

This project aims to design and build a cost-effective, real-time Indoor Air Quality monitoring system using an ESP32 FireBeetle microcontroller programmed in MicroPython.

The system will:

#Measure key environmental parameters:

- Temperature & Humidity

- General Air Quality (CO2, VOCs)

- Particulate Matter (PM2.5 & PM10)

- Display the data locally on an OLED screen for immediate feedback.

- Transmit the collected data via Wi-Fi to a cloud-based web dashboard for remote monitoring and historical data logging.
